### Lessons 
Skipping straight to this to document the most important things
- First of all, implementing orm on my own is a really bad idea.
- Secondly, making things objects and abstractions is wasting more time than good
- Really really understood why the old functional programming thing is so worshipped over oop everything in the context of most front-end web dev community.

#### The good parts
- Really, Really got familiar with promise even though they were used all over the place unnecessarily, the purpose is not to get things done, but about experimenting and exploring.
- Went through a really really wild ride of thinking and reasoning about dependency inversion and end up not being able to applying anything, for now, but definitely gotten a bit better with the thinking process.
